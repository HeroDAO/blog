A quick guide with as much information about how to join our DAO.

## What does it mean to be a member?

Joining the DAO means you have voting shares in the Moloch DAO that represent ownership and can be exchanged for an equal percentage of the value in our vault, as well as other community benefits like access to all the private discord channels.

Prerequisites:

- A web3 wallet like [metamask](https://metamask.io).
- You have joined our discord.

Join Hero DAO
These directions will walk you through making a proposal to join, pledging some capital, and getting shares in the DAO.

1. Join a Town Hall or hangout in #general in discord. Get to know us, what we're building together, and if you like the vibe consider joining officially.
2. Post a Membership proposal in the Membership-proposal channel on discord. Who are you and why do you want to join?

General rule unless otherwise discussed and decided by community is 1 wxDAI pledged = 1 Member share

There are several ways to get xDAI tokens, with fiat or otherwise. Check official docs for that here.

Pledging:

1. Get some wrapped xDAI, on the xDAI network. If you need help setting up a wallet or getting some crypto, just ask. You can swap xdai for wrapped xdai (wxdai) here https://wrapeth.com/
2. Head to our DAO page and create a new membership proposal https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x82b09c514d5427c8184b2fe7dc9fa632a6c05c26/proposals
3. pledge 1 wrapped xDAI token per Share that you request. Make sure to link to your discord post.
4. Members will vote on your proposal.

If you find that you need some help with any step, just ask, getting setup can be confusing. But once you're in, its just voting yes/no on proposals and being a community member
