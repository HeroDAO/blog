# What is Moon Rock exactly?

Moon Rock is a token, which holds no inherit value, issued by Hero DAO as a reward for everyone who played with and participated in the DAO, that can been used to redeem awesome prizes. Moon Rock is not a governance token, as Hero DAO is governed by non-transferable DAO shares. Moon Rock is like tickets at an arcade that you've been rewarded for playing games, and with it you can pick some prizes from behind the counter.

## What are the prizes?

Primarily, you can use Moon Rock to redeem comic books, and other products that HeroDAO produces, as part of our community owned super hero franchise.

# Where did Moon Rock come from?

Moon Rock was created with input and help by dozens of members of HeroDAO and our extended community. It was launched as a community effort on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain (formerly xdai) networks. You can easily swap the token between networks using the Omni Bridge.

# What can I do with my Moon Rock?

At launch the primary thing you can do with Moon Rock is redeem it for Moon Girl Issue #1, First Addition NFTs, at a price according to a bonding curve.

You can also add your Moon Rock to Swapr to provide liquidity. Stake that liquidity in the Swapr farms for additional rewards.

# Where can I get Moon Rock? Do I smell an Airdrop?

You might already have some! 33% of the total 1 billion Moon Rock tokens were airdropped to:

- All Hero DAO members
- All artists, writers, and editors who participated in the creation of the first Moon Girl comic book
- Meta Cartel, MetaGame seed holders as of December 8th.
- Original Minters of Punks Comic (Not directly affiliated.)
- The Greatest Larp participants as of 12/14 (Not directly affiliated.)

Most of the remaining Moon Rock is locked in the Hero DAO treasury, where the DAO members can decide on what to do with it, including incentivizing liquidity for it on Swapr or other exchanges.
